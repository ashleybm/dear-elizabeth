# Dear Elizabeth...
Our website that is hosted here: for an rpg letter writing game from [200wordrpg](https://200wordrpg.github.io/2018/rpg/winner/2018/05/28/DearElizabeth.html). This is my attempt at making the website accessible and easy to edit for whoever wishes to. I'll explain the basics, and you'll be able to do a lot more than you think :) 

## Readers Digest for Code:
This file is written in a formating language that is easily to read for directions called markdown(`.md` files)<sub>1</sub>. The actual website is on pages that have `.html` at the end of them. They may be under a folder like `profiles` or `templates`. 

### Inside `profiles`

Your profile will have a certain set up on it's page that holds stuff. I've taken away the hardship of messing with the side panel, so that you can either keep the whole thing or remove/adjust at your convience. This is _just_ like myspace <3

You should visit the readers digest numbered<sub>1</sub>, if you see references like that in text, it will be a number within the same file, <sub>1-filename</sub> for references outside the file.


### Inside `templates`
Templates are small bits of code that you can insert. At the top of each file, will be a direct link to only that asset to go into your template. For example, you want a top 5 friends template to insert into your site. Or a spotify playlist! The possibilities are endless.

Example usage of a template:

1. Start by locating the folder you wish to add the file or changes too?

    a. Should be under a `profile`, `site`, or `template` directory.
    
2. Find the file you wish to add the template too should end in `.html`

3. Locate the place you wish to include the content, some templates will have directions or point to steps on how to adjust the formatting to look the way you want. 

4. See it appear on your page.
