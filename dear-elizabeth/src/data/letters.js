    content: `I didn't anticipate the reading I received in Spring, but I should have taken it as a warning. In the circle on my tray, were 2 crossed bones, my first silver dollar from bartending, and a gum wrapper from our last trip. Now at first, I was hoping this meant one of you would come into great wealth, but since two of these items were new, I didn't know what to expect from them. 

After the last few months, I can say I have a better understanding.

Steph and Rebecca came into the bar one night. I was sure they'd have brought Ant with them, but they came alone. They asked me for a surprise cocktail and since I had a lot of extra gin, I made them a Bramble. You know it- lemon- for protection. When I came back to ask if they wanted another, they were liplocked- and in the furthest back booth in the bar.

They had always hated each other in college. Especially after Steph hit Rebecca's parked car at 20 mph in third year. So I just stood there, slack jawed, and wondered how we'd gotten there. Then, I worried. In throwing something together, I'd forgotten to consider that all components have multiple uses. Will is will, but lemon also helps lubricate emotions, especially in that department. They jumped apart and Steph looked terrified. She ran out of the bar, and Rebecca looked at me like I'd lit her hair on fire. 

Steph had been at the bar the night prior with her boyfriend Matthew, and so of course I kept my mouth shut. But I didn't hear from either of them for almost a week, until Rebecca dropped by with a loaf of bread, and asked for a cure for heartbreak. This was where I needed the warning- because it turned out that Matthew showed at the bar looking for Rebecca not more than two weeks later. He came in with a metal bat, wet curls hairsprayed so hard that a match would have had him bald in an instant.

When he opened his mouth? I was tempted.`
