    biography: [
      "In the mystical embrace of Salem, Massachusetts, Lorelei Tempest Blair was born on a storm-laden night in the summer of 1962 to Elaine Blair and her husband Theodore Blair, (formerly Proctor, yes, he took his wife's surname). The Blair family, renowned for their deep connection to ancient magic, could trace their lineage back through generations of gifted witches, now combined with the Proctor line.",
      "From a young age, Lorelei exhibited an innate affinity for the natural elements. Her laughter seemed to summon playful breezes, and when she danced, raindrops fell in a gentle rhythm. Elders in the Blair family recognized the signs—a Storm Weaver was emerging among them, destined to wield the power of storms.",
      "Lorelei's grandmother, Maeve Blair, a wise and weathered Storm Weaver, became her mentor. In the quiet corners of their historic Salem home, Maeve unveiled the mysteries of stormcraft. Lorelei eagerly absorbed the ancient knowledge, her bond with her grandmother deepening with every passing storm.",
      "On the eve of Lorelei's 18th birthday, a tempest of extraordinary proportions engulfed Salem. Lightning painted the sky in hues of blue, revealing the majestic form of the Thunderbird—the mythical guardian tied to the Blair lineage. Lorelei felt a surge of energy as the Thunderbird bestowed its blessing upon her, marking her as a true Storm Weaver."
